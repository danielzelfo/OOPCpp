# Geometric Shapes Program
C++ Geometric Shapes Program

This Program uses the Polygon abstract class to make a subclass which are different polygons.

The Triangle and Rectangle classes are subclasses of the Polygon abstract class and are also abstract.

The Square class is a subclass of the Rectangle Class. The RightTriangle, EquilateralTriangle, and IsoscelesTriangle classes are subclasses of the TriangleClass.

Each class has their own area function that overrode the area function of the base class. The perimeter function was the same for all the subclasses, so no subclasses overrode the perimeter class.

 the program also implements vertices into creating the polygons
 
 a user is able to create any triangle using three vertices or and parallelogram (including rectangle and square) using 4 verties
